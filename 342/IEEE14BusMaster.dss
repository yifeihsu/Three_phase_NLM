/*
Network data extracted from MatPower Version 7.1.
All per unit values converted to actual values with the formula Z_pu = Z_Ohms/Z_base
where Z_base = (KV_LL)^2/MVA_base
MVA_base = 100MVA
Bus Voltage KV_LL = 1kV (Since VBus Voltages are not mentioned in Common Data Format, Assumed KV_LL = 1kV based on ETAP IEEE14Bus Model)

Susceptance B (in microS) = (B_pu x 10^6)/Z_base
